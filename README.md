## Proposed project architecture

Initial architecture proposal by Ane:

2 main pipelines:

1. Training
   1. Input artifact: testing images
   2. Image preprocessing
   3. Data augmentation
   4. Hyperparameter tuning
   5. Design model
   6. Train model (steps 3 and 4 are repeated multiple times until finding appropriate hyperparameters)
   7. Deploy model
   8. Output artifact: model endpoint
2. Testing
   1. Input artifact: testing images
   2. Image preprocessing (same as in training pipeline)
   3. Call model endpoint
   4. Retrieve and parse results
   5. Output artifacts: test results

Based on test results, the model might be retrained, the preprocessing algorithm modified, etc.

* Yellow boxes are meant to be development steps (data science related)
* Red boxes are meant to be operations steps (AWS related)
  * At least model training and 
* Rhombus is for artifacts
  * Blue is input artifacts, images
  * Green is the model endpoint
  * Purple is test results, which we will use to improve our system
